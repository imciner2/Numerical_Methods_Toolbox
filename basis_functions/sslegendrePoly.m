function [ val, T ] = sslegendrePoly( x, n, mi, ma )
%SSLEGENDREPOLY Evaluate the shifted and scaled Legendre polynomial at point x
%   
% Compute the 1D Legendre polynomial of the first order of degree n at the
% given point x. This Legendre polynomial will shift the provided
% points such that they are contained in the range [-1,1] (where the
% Legendre polynomial is valid), and scale the polynomial to be 1 at x=0.
%
%
% Usage:
%   [ val, T ] = SSLEGENDREPOLY( x, n, mi, ma )
%
% Inputs:
%   x  - Point at which to compute the polynomial
%   n  - Order of the polynomial to compute
%   mi - The minimum of the interval
%   ma - The maximum of the interval
%
% Outputs:
%   val - Result for the highest order polynomial
%   T   - Results for all orders up-to and including the one requested
%

%% Determine the dimension of the data and create the matrix
rx = reshape(x, [], 1);     % make the points into a column vector
d = length(x);


%% Create the constants for shifting and scaling
al = (ma + mi)/2;
rh = (ma - mi)/2;


%% Shift and scale x to create the inputs to the Legendre poly function
nx = (rx - al)./rh;
dx = -al/rh;


%% Create the polynomial values for the numerator and denominator
[~, inter_num] = legendrePoly(nx, n);
[~, inter_den] = legendrePoly(dx, n);


%% Compute the final polynomial values
T = inter_num./inter_den;


%% The Legendre polynomial's value is the last element of the array
val = T(:,end);
