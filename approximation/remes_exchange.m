%REMES_EXCHANGE Remes Exchange algorithm to compute the minimax polynomial
%over a discrete set
%
% Find the minimax polynomial using a discrete set of points as the
% function to match instead of a continuous function. This function uses
% the Remes Exchange Algorithm to compute the polynomial. An overview of
% this method and the minimax problem can be found inside:
%   W. Fraser, “A Survey of Methods of Computing Minimax and Near-Minimax
%   Polynomial Approximations for Functions of a Single Independent
%   Variable,” J. ACM, vol. 12, no. 3, pp. 295–314, 1965.
%
%
% Usage:
%   [ b, E ] = REMES_EXCHANGE( n, x );
%   [ b, E ] = REMES_EXCHANGE( n, x, poly );
%   [ b, E ] = REMES_EXCHANGE( n, x, poly, MITER );
%   [ b, E ] = REMES_EXCHANGE( n, x, poly, MITER, origin );
%   [ b, E ] = REMES_EXCHANGE( n, x, poly, MITER, origin, RITER );
%
% Inputs:
%   n      - The order of the polynomial to use
%   x      - The datapoints to fit to (each point is a row)
%   poly   - The polynomial type to use. This type must be supported by the
%            vandermonde function (default Monomial).
%   MITER  - The maximum number of iterations to use (default 1000).
%   origin - Force this value at the origin
%   RITER  - The number of iterations to run before restarting (default
%            500). To disable restarting, pass in 0.
%
% Outputs:
%   b - The polynomial coefficients (lowest ordered first)
%   E - The minimax error for the polynomial
%
